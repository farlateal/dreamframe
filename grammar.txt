#BIMAN GUJRAL
#Symbols in the grammar are case-sensitive.
#
# This grammar uses a convention that
#    - terminals are lowercase          (president)
#    - preterminals are capitalized     (Noun)
#    - other nonterminals are all-caps  (NP)
#######################
##Rules have been added to support Pronouns.
#There is no gender consideration since the addition of pronouns is not in
#reference to a previously used subject of sentence. Rather, they create sentences like
#"You think that..." or "The citizens choose him/her/them." and so on.
#More examples in README.

# Rules for creating full sentences.

# The basic grammar rules.  Here's what the abbreviations stand for:
#    S  = sentence
#    NP = noun phrase
#    VP = verb phrase
#    PP = prepositional phrase
#    Det = determiner (sometimes called "article")
#    Prep = preposition
#    Adj = adjective
